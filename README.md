# Steering-Optimization  
Steering System Optimization  
Given:  
  -Wheelbase length  
  -Tie rod angle  
  -Steering rack travel  
  -Track width  
  -Steering rack length  
  -Steering thickness  
Finds  
  -Rack spacing  
  -Tie rod length  
  -Steering arm length  
How to use code:  
-1 Designate the number of steps and granularity.  
-2 Change Constant variables to fit your design constraint.  
-3 Input lower and upper bounds on the variables you want to find.  
Output:  
-1 Minimum RMSE  
-2 The optimal geometry  
-3 Number of valid RMSE's checked  
-4 Lowest 5 RMSE values    
-5 Graph of the ideal Ratio in bolded black and the best RMSE ratio in dotted red line
